## Let's Learn Spring

### Initial set up process

1. [official Spring website](https://spring.io/)
2. [Download](https://spring.io/tools) STS IDE *optional:but it provides everything in one place* or use [spring starter](https://start.spring.io/) to create spring template, download and import in eclipse or any IDE of your choice.
3. I use maven build (you can also use gradle if you are comfortable with)
4. start coding.
5. Refer [Spring Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/) in case if you need some additional reference.

### My first Spring Boot Application
*well, it does Nothing!*
